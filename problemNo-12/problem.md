## Median
---
The median of a list of numbers is essentially its middle element after sorting. The same number of elements occur after it as before. Given a list of numbers with an odd number of elements, find the median?

### Example
---
arr = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4] <br>
The sorted arr' = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].<br> The middle element and the median is 3.
