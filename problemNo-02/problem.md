## Counting Valleys
---
An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly  steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, , or a downhill,  step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a  unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:
- A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
- A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.

### Example
---
steps = 8 path = [DDUUUUDD]<br>
The hiker first enters a valley 2 units deep. Then they climb out and up onto a mountain 2 units high. Finally, the hiker returns to sea level and ends the hike.
