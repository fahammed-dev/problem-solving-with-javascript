## FizzBuzz
---
🔴Fizzbuzz is one of the most basic problems in the coding interview world. Try to write a small and elegant code for this problem.***

---
Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N. <br><br>
But for multiples of 3 the array should have “Fizz” instead of the number. <br><br>
For the multiples of 5, the array should have “Buzz” instead of the number. <br><br>
For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, the array should have “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.

---
Example: <br>
A = 5 <br>
Return: [1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz]
